## What Is This

Career-Ops turns Claude Code (or GitHub Copilot) into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a structured A-F scoring system (10 weighted dimensions)
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Processes in batch** -- parallel Claude workers, or Copilot agents plus GitHub Actions JD collection
- **Tracks everything** in a single source of truth with integrity checks

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career-ops is a filter -- it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable, and so is the recruiter's. Always review before submitting.

Career-ops is agentic: Claude Code can navigate career pages with Playwright, while GitHub Copilot uses the `.github/` agents, prompts, and instruction files in this repo. Both paths evaluate fit by reasoning about your CV vs the job description (not keyword matching), then adapt your resume per listing.

> **Heads up: the first evaluations won't be great.** The system doesn't know you yet. Feed it context -- your CV, your career story, your proof points, your preferences, what you're good at, what you want to avoid. The more you nurture it, the better it gets. Think of it as onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.


## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-Pipeline** | Paste a URL, get a full evaluation + PDF + tracker entry |
| **6-Block Evaluation** | Role summary, CV match, level strategy, comp research, personalization, interview prep (STAR+R) |
| **Interview Story Bank** | Accumulates STAR+Reflection stories across evaluations -- 5-10 master stories that answer any behavioral question |
| **Negotiation Scripts** | Salary negotiation frameworks, geographic discount pushback, competing offer leverage |
| **ATS PDF Generation** | Keyword-injected CVs with Space Grotesk + DM Sans design |
| **Portal Scanner** | 45+ companies pre-configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Retool, n8n...) + custom queries across Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever, Wellfound |
| **Batch Processing** | Parallel Claude workers, Copilot-guided sequential batches, and GitHub Actions JD collection |
| **Dashboard TUI** | Terminal UI to browse, filter, and sort your pipeline |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | AI evaluates and recommends, you decide and act. The system never submits an application -- you always have the final call |
| **Pipeline Integrity** | Automated merge, dedup, status normalization, health checks |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/ORION2809/carrer-ops.git
cd carrer-ops && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # Required for PDF generation

# 2. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies

# 3. Add your CV
# Create cv.md in the project root with your CV in markdown

# 4. Choose your AI agent
claude   # Claude Code path
# or open the project in VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled

# Then ask your agent to adapt the system to you:
# "Change the archetypes to backend engineering roles"
# "Translate the modes to English"
# "Add these 5 companies to portals.yml"
# "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting"

# 5. Start using
# Paste a job URL or run /career-ops
```

> **The system is designed to be customized by the AI agent itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask Claude Code or GitHub Copilot to change them. The agent reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

## Usage

With Claude Code, career-ops is a single slash command with multiple modes:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Fill application forms with AI
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → LinkedIn outreach message
/career-ops deep           → Deep company research
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.

### Using with GitHub Copilot

Career-ops also works with GitHub Copilot in VS Code. Instead of slash commands, use agents and prompts:

```
@auto-pipeline {paste JD} → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
@evaluator                → Single offer A-F evaluation
@scanner                  → Scan portals for new offers
@pipeline                 → Process pending URLs
@batch                    → Batch evaluate multiple offers
@apply                    → Fill application forms with AI
/generate-pdf             → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/outreach                 → LinkedIn outreach message
/deep-research            → Deep company research
/compare-offers           → Compare and rank offers
/tracker                  → View application status
/evaluate-training        → Evaluate a course/cert
/evaluate-project         → Evaluate a portfolio project
/career-ops               → See all commands
```

See [docs/COPILOT-MIGRATION.md](docs/COPILOT-MIGRATION.md) for the full Copilot guide.
